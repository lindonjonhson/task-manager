# Task Manager

This project was originally created by Devstackr.

Also, I've made a few changes to the project:
 - Added some routes to the API so you could get single tasks and lists.
 - Used the task/list data whenever we wanted to edit them.

## Descrition

This is a project using the MEAN Stack. Besides that we used some frameworks such as Bulma, Nodemon, Express, Mongoose and JWT for authentication.
